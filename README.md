# Clipboard Cess
A chess server final project for the CSD 122 class at LWTech

# Public Page

There is a public page up at https://pure-woodland-88435.herokuapp.com/ ! Try the app!

# Setup
The project requires nodejs to run. After you have node installed, you can install all the other dependencies with the command:

`npm install` 

After running npm install you can start the server by running the command

`node index.js --port 8080`

This will start the server on localhost:8080. You can now navigate to that link in your browser to use the project. To see how the project works you can open two tabs at localhost:8080. On the first tab you will press the 'create a game' button to create a game. There will be a GameID at the top of the screen that you can paste into the second window to join the game.

Now make a move on each board to play chess! You will notice that a move you make on one board will be updated on the other board.
